# Global Sports Footwear Sales Performance
I created a Global Sports Footwear Sales Performance project using Excel to analyze sales trends, regional performance, and product-level insights across global markets. The analysis highlights key metrics such as total sales, revenue contribution by region, and top-performing footwear categories, supported by pivot tables, charts, and interactive dashboards. This project demonstrates how Excel can be effectively used for business analysis and decision-making through structured data modeling and clear visual insights.
